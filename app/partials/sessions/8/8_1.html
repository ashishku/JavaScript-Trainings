<h4>Client Side Storage</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="label label-info">Cookies</span>
    <br/>Cookies are an old client-side storage mechanism that was designed for use by
server-side scripts. An awkward JavaScript API makes cookies scriptable on the
client-side, but they are hard to use and are suitable only for storing small amounts
of textual data. Also, any data stored as cookies is always transmitted to the server
with every HTTP request, even if the data is only of interest to the client.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="label label-info">Web Storage</span>
    <br/>Web Storage is an API that was originally defined as part of HTML5 but was spun
off as a standalone specification. That specification is still in draft form, but it is
partially (and interoperably) implemented in all current browsers including IE8.
    <ul>
      <li>localStorage</li>
      <li>sessionStorage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="label label-info">IE userData</span>
    <br/>Microsoft implements its own proprietary client-side storage mechanism, known
as “userData,” in IE5 and later. userData enables the storage of medium amounts
of string data and can be used as an alternative to Web Storage in versions of IE
before IE8.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="label label-info">Offline Web Applications</span>
    <br/>HTML5 defines an “Offline Web Applications” API that allows the caching of web
pages and their associated resources (scripts, CSS files, images, and so on). This is
client-side storage for web applications themselves rather than just their data, and
it allows web apps to install themselves so that they are available even when there
is no connection to the Internet.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="label label-info">Web Databases</span>
    <br/>Developers who need to work with really huge amounts of data like to use data-
bases, and the most recent browsers have started to integrate client-side database
functionality into their browsers. Safari, Chrome, and Opera include a client-side
API to a SQL database. The standardization effort for that API has failed, however,
and it is unlikely to be implemented by Firefox or IE. An alternative database API
is being standardized under the name “Indexed Database API.” This is an API to
a simple object database without a query language. Both of the client-side database
APIs are asynchronous and require the use of event handlers, which makes them
somewhat complicated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="label label-info">Filesystem API</span>
    <br/>Modern browsers support a File object that allows user selected files to be uploaded through an XMLHttpRequest. 
    Related draft standards define an API for obtaining a private local filesystem and for reading and writing files from and to that filesystem.
