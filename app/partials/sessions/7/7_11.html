<h4>Cross-Origin HTTP Requests</h4>
As part of the same-origin security policy, the XMLHttpRequest object can normally issue HTTP requests only to the server from which the document that uses it
was downloaded. 
<br/>
This restriction closes security holes, but it is heavy-handed and also prevents a number of legitimate uses for cross-origin requests.
<br/>
You can use cross-origin URLs with form and iframe elements, and the browser will display the resulting cross-origin document. 
<br/>
But because of the same-origin policy, the browser wonâ€™t allow the original script to inspect the contents of the cross-origin document. 
<br/>
With XMLHttpRequest, document contents are always exposed through the responseText property, so the same-origin policy cannot allow XMLHttpRequest to make cross-origin requests.
<hr/>
XHR2 allows cross-origin requests to websites that opt-in by sending appropriate CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers in their HTTP responses. 
Current versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome support CORS and IE8 supports it through a proprietary XDomainRequest object.

As a web programmer, there is nothing special you need to do to make this work: if the browser supports CORS for XMLHttpRequest and if the website you are trying to make
a cross-origin request to has decided to allow cross-origin requests with CORS, the same-origin policy will be relaxed and your cross-origin requests will just work.
