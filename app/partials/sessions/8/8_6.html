<h4>Typed Arrays</h4>
JavaScript arrays are general-purpose objects with numeric properties and a special length property. Array elements can be any JavaScript value. Arrays can grow or shrink dynamically and can be sparse. JavaScript implementations perform lots of optimizations
so that typical uses of JavaScript arrays are very fast. Typed arrays are array-like objects that differ from regular arrays in some important ways:
<ul>
  <li>The elements of a typed array are all numbers. The constructor used to create the typed array determines the type (signed or unsigned integers or floating point) and size (in bits) of the numbers.</li>
  <li>Typed arrays have a fixed length>.</li>
  <li>The elements of a typed array are always initialized to 0 when the array is created.</li>
</ul>
