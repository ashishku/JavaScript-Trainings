<h4>Type of Events</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Device-dependent input events</strong><br/>
These are events that are directly tied to a specific input device, such as the mouse
or keyboard. They include legacy event types such as “mousedown”, “mousemove”, “mouseup”, “keydown”, “keypress”, and “keyup” 
and also new touch specific events like “touchmove” and “gesturechange”.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Device-independent input events</strong><br/>
  These are input events that are not directly tied to a specific input device. The click
event, for example, indicates that a link or button (or other document element)
has been activated. This is often done via a mouse click, but it could also be done
by keyboard or (on touch-sensitive devices) by gesture.
  </li>
  <li><strong>User interface events</strong><br/>
  UI events are higher-level events, often on HTML form elements that define a user
interface for a web application. They include the focus event (when a text input
field gains keyboard focus), the change event when the user changes the value
displayed by a form element, and the submit event when the user clicks a Submit
button in a form.
  </li>
  <li><strong>State-change events</strong><br/>
    Some events are not triggered directly by user activity, but by network or browser
activity, and indicate some kind of lifecycle or state-related change. The load event,
fired on the Window object when the document is fully loaded, is probably the
most commonly used of these events.
  </li>
  <li><strong>API-specific events</strong><br/>
    A number of web APIs defined by HTML5 and related specifications include their
own event types. The drag-and-drop API defines events such as “drag-start”, “dragenter”, “dragover”, and “drop”. 
Applications that want to define custom drag sources or drop targets must handle some of these events.
The HTML5 video and audio elements define a long list of associated event types
such as “waiting”, “playing”, “seeking”, “volumechange”, and so on. These events
are usually only of interest to web apps that want to define custom controls for
video or audio playback.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Timers and error handlers</strong><br/>
    Timers and error handlers  are part of
client-side JavaScript’s asynchronous programming model and are similar to
events. Although timers and error handlers are not discussed in this chapter, it is
useful to think of them as related to event handling..
