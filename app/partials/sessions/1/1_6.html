      Creating Variables

    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Declared Variables</em><br/>
        Variables can be declated with <span class="label label-info">var</span> keyword.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>Undeclared Variables</em><br />
        Its not mandatory to declare them, though in ECMAScript5 under strict mode an error is thrown for undeclared variables.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>Repeated declaration</em><br />
        It is legal and harmless to declare a variable more than once with the var statement. If the repeated declaration has an initializer, it acts as if it were simply an assignment statement.

      Variable scopes
    </summary>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Undeclared variables</em><br/>
        undeclared variables under global scope.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>Declared variables</em><br/>
        Declared variables have local scopes within the region they are declared.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Global Variables</em><br/>
            A variable declared in the global region (i.e outside any function) has a global scope.
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Function socpe</em><br/>
            Varibales in JavaScript do not support block scopes, instead they have function scopes.<br />
            It does not matter where you define your variable in  a function they are vissible through out the function. All parameters to function have the same scope.
            <br />
            A function scope variable hides the same named global variable.
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Scope chain / Closure scope</em><br/>
            This scope chain is a list or chain of objects that defines the variables that are “in scope” for that code.
            <br />
            In top-level JavaScript code , the scope chain consists of a single object, the global object.
            In a non-nested function, the scope chain consists of two objects. The first is the object that defines the function’s parameters and local variables, and the second is the global object.
            In a nested function, the scope chain has three or more objects.
            <br/>
            When a function is defined, it stores the scope chain then in effect.
            When that function is invoked, it creates a new object to store its local variables, and adds that new object to the stored scope chain to create a new, longer, chain
            that represents the scope for that function invocation.
