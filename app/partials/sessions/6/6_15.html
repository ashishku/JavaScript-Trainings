        <summary>Line Breaking</summary>
        <br/>As a further defense against the masking of errors by the semicolon insertion mechanism, 
        JSLint expects long statements to be broken only after one of these punctuation characters or operators:
        <br/>, . ; : { } ( [ = < > ? ! + - * / % ~ ^ | &amp;
        <br/>== != <= >= += -= *= /= %= ^= |= &amp;= << >> || &amp;&amp;
        <br/>=== !== <<= >>= >>> >>>=
        <br/>JSLint does not expect to see a long statement broken after an identifier, a string, a
        number, a closer, or a suffix operator:
        <br/>) ] ++ --

        <summary>var Statement</summary>
        JavaScript allows var definitions to occur anywhere within a function. JSLint is stricter.
        JSLint expects that:
        <ul>
            <li>A var will be declared only once, and that it will be declared before it is used.</li>
            <li>A function will be declared before it is used.</li>
            <li>Parameters will not also be declared as var s.</li>
        </ul>
        JSLint does not expect:
        <ul>
            <li>The arguments array to be declared as a var .</li>
            <li>That a variable will be declared in a block. This is because JavaScript blocks do
            not have block scope. This can have unexpected consequences, so define all variables 
            at the top of the function body.</li>

        <summary>Labels</summary>
        <br/>JavaScript allows any statement to have a label, and labels have a separate namespace.
        JSLint is stricter.
        JSLint expects labels only on statements that interact with break : switch , while , do ,
        and for . JSLint expects that labels will be distinct from variables and parameters.

        <summary>Unreachable Code/summary>
        <br/>JSLint expects that a return , break , continue , or throw statement will be followed by
a } or case or default .

      <details>
        <summary>Confusing Pluses and Minuses</summary>
        JSLint expects that + will not be followed by + or ++ , and that - will not be followed
  by - or -- . A misplaced space can turn + + into ++ , an error that is difficult to see. Use
  parentheses to avoid confusion.

        <summary>++ and --</summary>
        The ++ (increment) and -- (decrement) operators have been known to contribute to
        bad code by encouraging excessive trickiness. They are second only to faulty architecture 
        in enabling viruses and other security menaces. The JSLint option plusplus
        prohibits the use of these operators.

        <summary>eval Is Evil</summary>
        The eval function and its relatives ( Function , setTimeout , and setInterval ) provide
access to the JavaScript compiler. This is sometimes useful, but in most cases it indi-
cates the presence of extremely bad coding. The eval function is the most misused
feature of JavaScript.
