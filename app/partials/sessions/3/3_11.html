<div class="container">
  <strong>Class Attributes</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Object.getPrototypeOf() / isPrototypeOf()
    </li>

    <li>
      toString [object class]
    </li>

    <li>
      Object.preventExtensions() / Object.isExtensible()<br/>
      There is no way to make an object extensible again once you have made it nonextensible. 
      Also note that calling preventExtensions() only affects the extensibility of the object itself.
      If new properties are added to the prototype of a nonextensible object, the nonextensible object will inherit those new properties.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Object.seal() / Object.isSealed() <br/>
      It works like Object.preventExtensions() , but in addition to making the
object nonextensible, it also makes all of the own properties of that object nonconfig-
urable. This means that new properties cannot be added to the object, and existing
properties cannot be deleted or configured. Existing properties that are writable can
still be set, however. There is no way to unseal a sealed object.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Object.freeze() / Object.isFrozen()<br/>
      It locks objects down even more tightly. In addition to making the object
nonextensible and its properties nonconfigurable, it also makes all of the objectâ€™s own
data properties read-only. (If the object has accessor properties with setter methods,
these are not affected and can still be invoked by assignment to the property.)
    </li>

  <strong>Serializing Objects</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>JSON.stringify()</li>
    <li>JSON.parse()</li>
  </ul>
  JSON syntax is a subset of JavaScript syntax, and it cannot represent all JavaScript
values. Objects, arrays, strings, finite numbers, true , false , and null are supported and
can be serialized and restored. NaN , Infinity , and -Infinity are serialized to null . Date
objects are serialized to ISO-formatted date strings (see the Date.toJSON() function),
but JSON.parse() leaves these in string form and does not restore the original Date
object. Function, RegExp, and Error objects and the undefined value cannot be serial-
ized or restored. JSON.stringify() serializes only the enumerable own properties of an
object. If a property value cannot be serialized, that property is simply omitted from
the stringified output. Both JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() accept optional second
arguments that can be used to customize the serialization and/or restoration process
by specifying a list of properties to be serialized, for example, or by converting certain
values during the serialization or stringification process. Complete documentation for
these functions is in the reference section.
