          From the preface of book...

            "When I was a young journeyman programmer, I would learn about every feature of the languages I was using, 
            and I would attempt to use all of those features when I wrote. I suppose it was a way of showing off, 
            and I suppose it worked because I was the guy you went to if you wanted to know how to use a particular feature.
            Eventually I figured out that some of those features were more trouble than they were worth. 
            Some of them were poorly specified, and so were more likely to cause portability problems. 
            Some resulted in code that was difficult to read or modify. 
            Some induced me to write in a manner that was too tricky and error-prone. And some of those features were design errors. 
            Sometimes language designers make mistakes."
