  <strong>Bad Parts</strong>
  <br/>Things easy to avoid.
  <ul>
    <li>== &amp; !=
      <br/>Use === and !==
    </li>
    <li>with</li>
    <li>eval</li>
    <li>continue Statement
      <br/>Code can always be refactored to remove it and be more simple.
    </li>
    <li>switch Fall Through
      <br/> can be error prone
    </li>
    <li>Block-less Statements</li>
    <li>++ & --
      <br/>Most of the buffer overrun bugs that created terrible security vulnerabilities were due to code like this.
    </li>
    <li>Bitwise Operators
      <br/>In Java, the bitwise operators work with integers. JavaScript doesn’t have integers. It
only has double precision floating-point numbers. So, the bitwise operators convert
their number operands into integers, do their business, and then convert them back.
In most languages, these operators are very close to the hardware and very fast. In
JavaScript, they are very far from the hardware and very slow. JavaScript is rarely
used for doing bit manipulation.
As a result, in JavaScript programs, it is more likely that &amp; is a mistyped &amp;&amp; operator.
The presence of the bitwise operators reduces some of the language’s redundancy,
making it easier for bugs to hide.
    </li>
    <li>The function Statement Versus the function Expression
      <br/>function statement are always hoisted but expressions are not.
    </li>
    <li>Typed Wrappers
      <br/>This
turns out to be completely unnecessary and occasionally confusing. Don’t use new
Boolean or new Number or new String .
Also avoid new Object and new Array . Use {} and [] instead.
    </li>
    <li>new
      <br/> removing new makes any constructor a normal function.
    </li>
    <li>void
      <br/>In many languages, void is a type that has no values. In JavaScript, void is an opera-
tor that takes an operand and returns undefined . This is not useful, and it is very con-
fusing. Avoid void .
    </li>
  </ul>
