      <strong>Object Literals</strong><br />
      An object literal is a comma-separated list of colon-separated name:value pairs, en-
closed within curly braces. A property name is a JavaScript identifier or a string literal
(the empty string is allowed). A property value is any JavaScript expression; the value
of the expression (it may be a primitive value or an object value) becomes the value of
the property.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Creating Objects with new</strong><br />
      The new operator creates and initializes a new object. The new keyword must be followed
      by a function invocation. A function used in this way is called a constructor and serves
      to initialize a newly created object. Core JavaScript includes built-in constructors for
      native types.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Object.create</strong><br />
      ECMAScript 5 defines a method, Object.create() , that creates a new object, using its
first argument as the prototype of that object. Object.create() also takes an optional
second argument that describes the properties of the new object.
